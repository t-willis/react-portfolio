# React Portfolio

## Description

A Personal Portfolio created with React and Bootstrap.

I wanted to become more familiar with React and everything that comes along with developing a single-page application, and making a portfolio was a great way to do that. Along with the initial growing pains of learning a new platform I attempted to bring Bootstrap into the mix as my framework.

I was able to create a single-page portfolio that utilizes state management to set a page as active for the purpose of highlighting the active page in the nav-bar, as well as updating the url.

## Installation

This application is deployed on Netlify: [Click Here](https://portfolio-tw-20230912.netlify.app/)

If you want to deploy this app locally you'll need to do the following:

- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Type `npm install` in the terminal to install dependencies
- Type `npm run dev` in the terminal to run the local server
- Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser (this should open automatically)

## Usage

There are a few facets to this portfolio page, luckily none of them are too complicated.

- The 'About' page doubles as the home page and will be visible when a user initially navigates to the webpage
- The 'Portfolio' page is generated by iterating through an array of objects designated in the `Portfolio.jsx` file.
- The 'Contact' page currently doesn't actually contact anyone, but will validate user input for the name, email, and message fields. It also clears upon form submission.
- The 'Resume' page includes a link to my LinkedIn as well as a list of front-end and back-end proficiencies.
